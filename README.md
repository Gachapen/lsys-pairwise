# Pairwise comparison web survey for L-systems

This is a web application designed to let participants perform pairwise comparisons of videos of L-system plants and see the resulting ranking.
It designed specifically for one experiment and is thus not directly useful for other purposes, though it can be adapted to other experiments or generalized into a tool.

## Requirements

It requires [Rust >= 1.22.1](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) to build the backend.
[Node.js >= 9.2.1 and NPM >= 5.60](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are required to build the frontend.
